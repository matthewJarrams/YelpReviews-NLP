       "[\"So much to like about this place--the beautiful Mercer Building location, the spaciousness, the lovely, friendly baristas. But there are a couple of important cons for me. Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.\\n\\nSecondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.\\n\\nPros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas. I'd love to spend more time here, but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not a coffee connoisseur so I'm not reviewing it based on that. What I am reviewing it on is the fantastic ambiance it has, the free wifi, and the long meeting table that's available for everyone.\\n\\nWhenever I want to hang out and work downtown at a cafe, Roast is the first place I go to. \\n\\nMy only real complaint is that during some hours, this place is PACKED and so that may put a kink in your plans if you wanted to meet someone there for a meeting. Also wifi is sometimes touch and go. I wish more cafes installed the fastest wifi with signal boosters around the place to make it more useful for those who telework.\\n\\nI also love that this place is open LATE!\",\n",
       " \"I really loved it here, makes me wish I lived closer and could stop by everyday! I had the dark hot chocolate & it was made in every way I like. Milky, chocolatey, whipped creamy..y? They had a maple bacon latte I could've gone for buuuut I just wasn't ready for the challenge. The atmosphere is gorgeous. Wooden floors, dark decor, BIG comfy chairs makes it cozy and warm. They also have a great looking selection of wines and some snacks as well. I think if you're planning to take a date/ co-worker/ hipster friend/ parent here is a great place to do it.\\n\\nOnly down side is when I went I found it VERY CROWDED. My drink ALTHOUGH WORTH IT took a good while to come about and the lemony water in the pretty dispenser was empty & I was thirsty.\\n\\nI do love this hipster haven.\",\n",
       " \"The kids who work at Roast are friendly.  They screw up things once in a blue moon, but that's to be expected.\\n\\nThe cookies offered there are good.  They're not the best that I've ever had, but they're good all the same.\\n\\nThe pain au chocolate is terrible.  It's some kind of thick, chewy abomination.  Avoid it at all costs.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are overpriced by about 40%.\\n\\nThe drinks are good enough, but they're not particularly memorable.\",\n",
       " 'With a Toast to Roast, I say welcome to the E-town cafe scene! I spent a few hours in this welcoming and inviting space today working & amerced in the awe inspiring ambiance. Located in the historic & newly renovated Mercer building, this coffee house by day/wine bar by night has meticulously mastered creating a spacious environment that embodies the original charm and elegance I so hoped it would have. \\n\\nThe pastries are fresh and delicious, the intoxicating aroma of the Roasted beans is delish, and the ode to the London Fog called the Morning Mist put a sublime smile on my face for hours after. Yes, I think I have found another regular haunt!',\n",
       " \"Hope everybody had a nice Valentine's Day yesterday! I had a great dinner which lead right into our trip to San Francisco so I'll have to write about it later! In the mean time, just wanted to post up my visit to ROAST Coffeehouse on 104 St!\\n\\nIt took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.\\n\\nJoe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!\\n\\nFor that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!\\n\\nROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school! Perfect place to study. What's your favorite coffee place?\",\n",
       " \"I've only been once, but think Roast is worth plenty more trips in the future.\\n\\nThe take on a London Fog I had was pretty tasty. I like a little more sweetness but, then, a little less sugar is a healthy thing.\\n\\nThe place looks fantastic! As part of the re-birth of the Mercer Warehouse, Roast has all the exposed brick, wood, and everything else so often behind walls that anyone could ask for. A very cool space on Edmonton's new cool street. Let me know if you sit at their community table.\",\n",
       " \"I love Roast, it's my place to escape during a crazy day at the office. Yes, it's quite hipster but I still love it. The brick walls, the pressed tin ceiling, the local artwork and the reclaimed wood tables -- and of course the coffee. I was disappointed when they took their maple bacon latte off the menu, I think that drew in a lot of people here. But they said it cost too much to keep on the menu, unfortunately.\\n\\nI still enjoy the chocolate cherry latte, it's not as sweet as it sounds. The pumpkin pie latte is also good, and I hear the chai hot chocolate is a treat too. The toasted marshmallow latte is quite sweet though, just to warn you. For a cold option, I like the coconut frap .. it's nice and light, not too sweet. You can switch between cold and hot for most of these options though.\\n\\nI've always found their pastries to be delicious and never stale, unlike other coffee houses. The lemon swirl is to die for, if you like a strong lemon taste -- lots of flavour in every bite, with chunks of chewy lemon. Yum! The cinnamon swirl and chocolate croissants are also tasty. I was sad when they discontinued their key lime cookie, those were delicious! Unfortunately it wasn't popular enough so they took that off the menu too.\\n\\nGo earlier in the day if you want to score a pastry with your coffee, otherwise it's usually just sandwiches left by the afternoon and I'm not so sure about those if they've been left out since morning.\",\n",
       " \"Great meeting place in the mornings.  Lots of available parking and a great atmosphere.  The latte was really good and Roast has several different flavours that I can't normally find in the chain brands.\\n\\nService was really good and the drink was made quickly.  Wish they had a paper to read or Avenue magazine but there wasn't anything readily available, but that isn't a huge deal.\\n\\nSeating is really comfortable and is far better than the mostly wooden chairs you find at large chain coffee shops.  I'll be back again and again.\",\n",
       " \"Roast where have you been all my life! How do I love thee, let me count the ways!  1. Being surrounded by what seems like the most comfortable coffee shop seating in the city. 2. Nice exposed brick of a past era. 3. Reclaimed old wood flooring. 4. Down to earth extremely friendly staff. 5. A good mix of the business, student and everyone else crowd. 6. Cozy gas fireplaces. 7. An all around cool atmosphere. All these factors have a way of making 2 or 3 hours fly by. \\n\\nI got med coffee ($3) and a MAPLE BACON cinnamon bun ($3.75). Nothing here is cheap and admittedly the coffee isn't the best in the city. But I really love the atmophere.\\n\\nMy only complaints would be that the music can be a little too loud and that some of the tables are wobbly. However, this is one of my favourite places to meet someone for coffee.\\n\\nI absolutely, positively, most definitely, unequivocally, with out a doubt, love Roast!\",\n",
       " \"Roast has been around for a little while now, and do indeed have excellent coffee. The café is moderately sized and fairly open, but it makes up for the open space by creating comfortable nooks and separate seating areas throughout the room. There are couches towards the street-side, booths and high tables near the middle, and high-backed chairs and coffee tables located in the direction of the rear.\\n\\nIt isn't just the coffee or the rustic atmosphere that makes Roast so fantastic, though. They've recently undergone a menu overhaul and, rather than just the usual cakes, pastries, and sweets, now offer breakfast and lunch options à la Chef Andrew Parker, which change daily.\\n\\nAnd, yeah...they sell wine. It's always a tough decision for me once I reach the counter at Roast, since I love coffee and I adore wine. Roast's wine selection is fabulous because it serves up a variety of reds, whites, and rosés from across Canada, keeping it local and supporting wineries from the Okanagan and Niagara regions.\\n\\nThe café is also a great location for holding events (particularly literary/artsy ones) or hosting a meeting (they have a Community Room to accommodate them).\\n\\nDid I mention that they serve a Maple Bacon Latte? (I knew that would sell you on it.)\",\n",
       " \"Delicious coffee, great service, wonderful atmosphere.\\nBest soy vanilla latte in town. I don't care how much it costs, it's the best.  But don't you worry, the prices are similar to those of other coffee joints in Edmonton.\",\n",
       " \"A great trendy coffee house on my favourite street in the city. Roast is great for a couple reasons 1) they have amazing lattes, the salted caramel is definitely something to be sought after 2) the prices aren't much higher than that of Starbucks. \\n\\nThe boyfriend and I adore coffee in a can't-function-without-it-in-the-morning kind of a way. We are always on the lookout for great coffee places and Roast definitely falls into that category! \\n\\nWe were both pleasantly surprised to find a maple bacon latte on the menu and of course the boyfriend had to try it. I was also happy to see wine (and Canadian wine at that) on their menu. Canadian wines are typically some of the best wines around! \\n\\nRoast also introduced me to a great new rewards program, Perka! I was happy to learn that after 6 coffees you receive a free drink! This rewards program trumps any Starbucks gold star reward program. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to this great little coffee house!\",\n",
       " \"I really love Roast, though I find it expensive. They serve your standard coffee drinks, with some twists like a bacon & maple latte. I love the option of ordering a beer or wine when I meet my friend for coffee, because sometimes, at the end of a work day, that's just what you need. They don't have a bad collection either, and I'm impressed with the unique variety of import bottles. Roast is a nice venue too, with exposed beams and brick, and they frequently have live music. There's few things more wonderful than curling up in an armchair in front of a fire with a good drink, and listen to someone strum a guitar. Roast is a regular stop on my favorite coffeeshop rotation, and I'll keep coming back for more.\",\n",
       " 'By far, my favourite coffeehouse in the city! I have never had great coffee until I started going to Roast. \\n\\nWe stop in at least once a week, more if I have the time. I usually have the pleasure of seeing Josh in the mornings, and he is just so friendly (as is all the staff there) and I am pretty sure he remembered my name after the first time I came to Roast.\\n\\nThe drinks are all fabulous, and the small amount of food I have tried here, I have enjoyed. \\n\\nOh if you remember to, order one of their cookies! They are delicious and I am sad I only discovered them almost a year after they opened.',\n",
       " \"I was surprised to hear that this place had closed. Too cool for Edmonton. It's also a difficult balance for a cafe between making a place feel cosy enough to spend hours there, and having people actually buy 1 drink and spending hours there.\",\n",
       " \"The decor is fantastic and the staff are friendly. The coffee profile is a little dark for my liking, and the music is 50% terrible, but the atmosphere is otherwise a joy. I've enjoyed some nice events there as well.\",\n",
       " \"No Wheelchair Access!\\n\\n- How is it that they just did a giant renovation, and somehow managed to get by the requirement to install a ramp and wheelchair accessible washrooms?\\n\\nIf you would like to try this coffee house, you'd better not be in a wheelchair.\",\n",
       " 'I went there yesterday afternoon for the first time ever, and I feel like an idiot for not going there everyday since they opened.\\n\\nVery lovely and cozy atmosphere, great for coffee and chat with friends, and for working or studying.\\n\\nTheir coffee is simply fantastic, the baristas are incredible at what they do. Highly recommended!',\n",
       " 'I really enjoy going to Roast to work during the day. They have amazing customer service, their espresso is pretty good, and the ambience is perfect for an afternoon of working. I would recommend their vanilla iced lattes. \\n\\nThe only thing I would say is make sure you get a spot by a charger, as there are only a few of them. Also use their loyalty program!',\n",
       " \"I'm always finding new ways to get in the way of a regular sleeping schedule so it doesn't surprise me that most of the time I head to Roast, I'm scooted out not long after because they're closing.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is part local and rustic feeling and the other part is a Jay Z and Kanye West collaborative album cover. Flash, shine, and wood. The tank of water for all customers is a nice touch especially when they chop some cucumber in there.\\n\\nThe coffee and tea menu is pretty plain and basic but the baristas know what they're doing and made sure I got my custom Gibraltar (3 parts espresso, 2 parts steamed milk) the way I want it. The most pleasant surprise was the wine and beer selection, I usually spy into the beer fridge and am forced make a difficult decision with a kind of beer or even getting one at all.\\n\\nRoast is a great place whether you're there to relax or have an awkward first date.\",\n",
       " \"As several other reviewers have observed, this place looks very good. One wants to like it. The management, however, is so clueless that I have decided to permanently give it a pass. There are so many really good places in this area where the management knows how to retain good people that one need not spend time in a place where the servers seem to change on a daily basis.\\n\\nWhen I buy high-priced coffee, I like to have it in a real mug, not a cardboard cup that I could get at any fast-food joint. When the people here mistakenly put mine in a cardboard cup, I did not ask for a new coffee. Instead, I politely pointed it out in the hopes that they would get it right the next time. In return, I got an argument and nasty looks from the crew at the counter. Also, no matter now many people they have at the counter, they manage to keep even small groups of customers waiting on long lines.\\n\\nYesterday was the kicker. I asked for a decaf coffee and told there was no decaf. Even your average diner will usually ask a customer if he or she wants to wait while they brew up a pot of decaf. And this is a fancy café? I then asked if they had decaf espresso and was told that this too was all out. The person telling me this clearly had no idea of her surroundings and thought she was working in some civil service office: nope, we ain't got it, too bad!\\n\\nWith so many good options down the block, this place should stop relying on their decor.\",\n",
       " 'just came by here today, great design and warm atmosphere. had the chocolate cherry frappucino. will definitely be back',\n",
       " \"Roast Coffeehouse has a lot going for it.  The ambience is lovely, located in the high-ceilinged Mercer building in the warehouse district.  Charming interiors, quite beautiful furniture, intriguing wall art, Edison-era light installations and what not.  They might have the best ambience any cafe in Edmonton has.  Perfect date place too, I think, with decent music playing and comfortable furniture for quiet conversations.\\n\\nI've been here twice and agree with most reviewers in that they make interesting latte creations and teas.   I think they briefly had a caramel-bacon latte which sounds really interesting and I enjoyed their salted caramel latte.  They have a collection of craft beers and wines mainly from AB and the Okanagan region.  It's interesting and I'm glad they support local craft brews and wines, though at least on the beer front, these regions are not known for the best craft brews in Canada.\\n\\nWhy the 3 stars? Many might consider me a coffee snob when I say this, but I actually think that for $5, it's only fair that the quality of the actual espresso be far better than something you would get at a chain coffee shop.  This, however, they lack in.  The staff seem to know very little about actual coffee and how to make a good espresso and this disappoints me a little.  It's got a bit of a yuppie feel to it without delivering a quality product.  \\n\\nI am not sure if I will go back because I know of places that make better coffee. There are many in Edmonton now (Elm, Transcend, Leva, Credo, Sugar Bowl, da Capo etc.) and to open up a new coffee shop and not strive to at least equal the bar set by these establishments, especially when they charge as much (some cases, more) as these other well established coffee joints, is a little disappointing for me.\\n\\nCome here for an interesting flavored latte, but don't come if you demand high quality coffee.  The main reason for three stars is that they claim to be a coffeehouse first and don't do too well, in my books, on that front.\",\n",
       " \"Roast is new to the coffee house scene in Edmonton, but they are some serious competition. Set in the delightfully trendy Mercer Building alongside Mercer Tavern, Startup Edmonton and FaBLOOMosity ( a flower shop), Roast's second floor decor is comfy luxury. \\n\\nThey are having some just-opened growing pains that involves installing a new transformer to handle the expresso machine but they are still open for business offering delectable breakfast and lunch options, brewed Verve coffee and some soul-changing loose leaf iced teas. \\n\\nAfter Friday's Social Media Breakfast at Startup Edmonton, a few of us work-tardy folks went down to sample Roast. \\n\\nGreeted right away by happy people, they won me over by spelling my name on my cup correctly without any prompts. Oh they know the way to a girl's heart. \\n\\nMy iced tea was a blend of sun-kissed fields, summer promises and a splash of warm rain and my friend's no-caffeine Italian soda option was made with hugs & kisses. \\n\\nOpening at 6 am means they are dedicated to the early morning downtown set. Actually their evening hours mean that downtown just got more accessible.\\n\\nMonday - 6:00am to 10:00pm\\nTuesday - 6:00am to 10:00pm\\nWednesday - 6:00am to 10:00pm\\nThursday - 6:00am to 10:00pm\\nFriday - 6:00am to 11:00pm\\nSaturday - 7:00am to 11:00pm\\nSunday - 8:00am to 9:00pm\\n\\nFollow them on Facebook/Twitter for tea & menu options as well as any specials they have each day.\",\n",
       " \"Transcend, Credo, and other such cafes are obsessive about their coffee. Roast is practical about it, but not as practical as Tim Horton's for example. Roast serves coffee from the artisan Verve Coffee Roasters. I don't know much about them, but the coffee is surprisingly non-bitter and smooth. You pay for the quality: $5 for a large latte. But included with that is the environment.\\n\\nLike the Mercer Tavern next door Roast takes advantage of the old warehouse in which it is housed. It's spacious, trendy, and comfortable; an atmosphere well worth a $5 latte.\\n\\nRoast also has some prepackaged quality food, I think from various downtown restaurants. The salads are small, but not too expensive. You can pay extra for your choice off protein (small containers of various meats or tofu). My friend seems to enjoy the baked goods.\\n\\nI prefer Transcend coffee and philosophy. But I come back here as often as I do for the non-pretentious atmosphere. Oh, and they start serving wine at 2pm.\",\n",
       " 'This is a diamond in the rough!  While the area of town felt a little sketchy, you walk through the doors of Roast and it\\'s like entering another world.\\n\\nThe smell of coffee was marvelously inviting and the decor made me want to spend the day there.\\n\\nTheir creativity with drinks is exceptional... the new seasonal drink is the \"Cinnamon Bun Latte\" and is exquisite.\\n\\nIf the location was a little bit easier to access, I could see making this a regular hangout.',\n",
       " \"I visited Roast for the first time on a Tuesday evening. It wasn't crazy busy, but still busier than I expected for a weekday. I can understand how it must get packed at certain times. It's a very comfortable and inviting space in a beautiful historic building. I had actually thought they served only coffee, but there's quite a selection of various drinks and teas, and a variety of food. The staff were pretty friendly and there's lots of seating. I definitely plan on returning to try some of their other drinks.\",\n",
       " \"Admittedly as I am not much of a coffee connoisseur, I judge a cafe based on how it makes me feel when I step inside. When I pay $5 for a fancy coffee, I want to feel like I'm indulging in some sort of fantasy world outside of my day-to-day reality.\\n\\nAnd the combination of tasty drinks such as the maple bacon latte (well, it's essentially a latte with whipped cream and a piece of candied bacon on top) and urban warehouse decor takes me to a trendier, more urban place than Edmonton.\\n\\nI like how they're making this an all day establishment and look forward to checking out their wine list.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty awesome little coffee shop in the building i used to play paintball in!\\n\\nThe last time I was in that room I had a gun in my hand and was part of the \"Law & Order\" paintball team.

       " \"We spent 26 hours in Edmonton and visited Roast twice.  The first was following supper.  Hubs used to live in Edmonton and knows the city fairly well so after reading some great reviews I knew we needed to seek it out.  As the name implies Roast is both a coffeehouse and wine bar.  They are however separated into two unique spaces.\\n\\nImmediately we loved the ambiance and decor of the coffeehouse.  Spacious & Airy it felt very comfortable.  The staff behind the counter were uber friendly and helpful.  They alone deserve 5 stars each for outstanding customer service.  They were chatty and very accommodating with our kids which also impressed us.\\n\\nWe picked up a few items to try, the cookie topped doughnut, maple bacon cinnamon bun, cookies and a pain au chocolat.  Also indulged in some hot cocoa (kids), a cappuccino for me and hubs tried the salted caramel latte.  Everything was heavenly but the salted caramel latte was the big winner for me and well the maple bacon cinnamon bun for hubs (anything with bacon, right?).  They also had a Bacon Latte on the menu but were out of the candied bacon so we didn't get to try (this time).\\n\\nThe next day we stopped in on our way out of town.  The same friendly peeps were working behind the counter and remembered us.  We picked up some more goodies and coffee (this time I got the salted caramel latte - heaven) and left a very satisfied family indeed.\\n\\nRoast  we'll be coming back soon for the bacon latte :)\",\n",
       " 'The Mercer Warehouse downtown and I have had a love affair that has been going on for years.  From the art installments, to the Halloween Parties and Ghost Tours to the building being empty for years.  When I was at the City Market downtown one weekend, I saw that they were restoring the building and it looked like maybe some new tenants.  I hoped that they were businesses and that they were not turning it into condos.\\n\\nMy prayers were answered and Roast Coffeehouse and Mercer Tavern were soon to be opened.\\n\\nYou would think that with my food obsession I would be one of the first people in on opening day...  Due to the busy summer I did not get to visit Roast until almost the end of August.  I had saw a tweet about a Maple Bacon Latte and knew I would have to drop in to see what they were all about.\\n\\nThe Bacon-Maple Latte is a maple flavoured latte. It is garnished with whipped cream and then a couple of pieces of caramelized Bacon.\\n\\nThe Bacon is fantastic! Crispy and gooey at the same time - it stuck to my teeth. Bacon lovers would love this taste experience.\\n\\nIf you want the latte to have any Bacon flavour in it you need to dunk one of your pieces of Bacon into the latte and let it float - that is, if you can resist eating it!\\n\\nThe Baristas at Roast took a while to get the latte out but it looked like they were having problems with one of the spouts on the espresso machine pulling shots. It was worth the wait - the shots were perfect.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and decor in Roast make for a very comfortable experience. The hardwood floors and open beamed ceiling are the originals from the warehouse. It has a rustic feel while the fireplaces give the atmosphere warmth and the stainless steel bar type chairs give it a touch of modern class. There are overstuffed leather chairs by the fireplaces so there are \"homey\" feels to certain areas as well. Sure to please many different types of customer.\\n\\nIf you like to avoid the hustle and bustle that the \"Green Giant\" offers - then you should give Roast a try. I can see myself curling up in front of a fireplace with a good book and a great cup of coffee for an hour or two.\\n\\nKudos Roast!',\n",
       " 'I\\'m on the fence about my feelings towards Roast Coffeehouse. While it does have many appealing qualities, there are certainly some things that are lacking. \\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe space is lovely. It has great ambience and is roomy and stylish with plenty of comfortable seating. It\\'s always cozy and warm, unlike many other cafes. There are nice little touches around, such as a self-serve dispenser with lemon water. This place doubles as a wine bar in the evenings and there\\'s a  decent selection of wine and beer. The baked goods are also quite good. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nThe service here is hit or miss. On some days, I have been greeted by a friendly face and on other days, I have had to deal with an unhelpful and lackadaisical hipster, whose description of the maple bacon latte was simply that it is \"sweet\". \\n\\nWhile they do have a small food menu, I have not had the chance to try anything as the one time I wanted to order something, I was informed that they were sold out of everything. This was at 4.p.m., which is the advertised time that they start serving food. \\n\\nThe coffee here is ok. While they do have a selection of interesting and creative drinks (Maple Bacon latte, salted caramel latte etc.), the actual quality and taste of the espresso is on par with, or marginally above,  most chain coffee shops. For the prices listed, you would expect better quality. This is not to say that the drinks are bad -- only that they could, and should, be better. \\n\\n\\nI will continue going to Roast, mainly for the ambience. While it does have some flaws, it is, overall, a nice spot.',\n",
       " \"I'm not a coffee coneiseuer to say the least, so I can't rate the finer points of the coffee - but what I will say is that the decor and ambiance of this little spot is fantastic. Other than music that is a little too loud for that atmosphere it was really nice.\\n\\nAs for the coffee - I thought that was really good too.\",\n",
       " \"Roast is a fantastic alternative to the chain coffee shops that dominate the downtown core. I went just after the coffeehouse had opened, so their espresso bar had yet to open, (it is functional now,) so I treated myself to one of the many fresh smoothie options on the menu. And how fresh! You don't get the feeling that you're drinking some powered icy-milk solution from a chain-shop here -- they use real fruit (albeit possibly canned? It didn't matter to me... it was tasty!)!  The baked goods are just as delicious; on-par for price as Starbucks or Second Cup, but bigger and fresh-tasting. \\n\\nPlus, the the location is huge! It looks fantastic, and I hope to have small work meetings here in the future!\",\n",
       " 'I had trouble placing the stars on this one because I actually love going to Roast, and enjoy it quite a bit. It is beautiful, tastes great, and is welcoming. BUT and this is a very big BUT for me. I understand that this business is new, and it\\'s busy so I have given it some grace in that regard towards the issues I have concerns with but after happening to me on 7 different visits now I have to say I\\'m fairly dissapointed. \\n\\nWhomever is in charge of doing orders for Roast really needs to figure out how to order in abundance or order more than they normally do or whatever it may be. I have gone there on 7 different occasions to order different drinks each time and I am always told \"sorry we\\'re out of this, or we\\'re out of that\" Thus forcing me to order a drink I could get anywhere and was really less than thrilled about trying. Especially when it\\'s a feature drink that you read on their FB page and decide yum! I\\'m going to go try it out and both times you visit during that special they are out of it. I once tried to get their Powered Chai literally 4 days in a row and they were out the entire time. Which was fine because I understood that they were new and the order had to come in and they gave me the option of trying their tea based chai. The time after that it was Pumpkin, the time after that it was the Apple Juice (out of Apple Juice?) \\n\\nI do love the atmosphere which is what keeps me going, and the drinks taste just fine, the desserts are delicious, and the service has been great, but the order issue is a serious bummer and definitely has me wanting to take the trip downtown for coffee meetings with clients less and less. \\n\\nHas the potential to be awesome though if they could get that glitch cleared up :)',\n",
       " 'Love the atmosphere. Coffee is pretty good. High prices, but I pay for the experience.',\n",
       " 'After hearing a steady stream of constant raves about Roast, I went out of my way to get there this afternoon. I can say with certainty that I love the atmosphere. The lighting is perfect, the place is huge, and there is a lot of seating - and of many different kinds, from tables and chairs, to comfy chairs, to sofas. I spent some time walking around and saw a good selection of loose coffee and tea for sale, pastries in the display case, and the wine and food list, which was not huge but decent. As for me, I took advantage of a free coffee offer this week and tried a medium roast. It was good, but did not knock my socks off. Still, just the fact this is an independent, local, non-chain place with a great vibe is enough to keep me coming back to try an espresso drink.',\n",
       " \"I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but this place was pretty nice. I had the Earl Gray Tea Misto and a Cookies and Cream Donut.  Tasty. The décor was warm and trendy. My boyfriend and I both liked the cool water dispenser that had slices of lemon in it. Refreshing.\",\n",
       " \"So Roast has become my new, kind of semi-ish regular coffee spot because it's so close to Grant MacEwan. I know I'm a student, and I should be saving my money to pay off my loans, but caffeine is a necessity and sometimes the line at Tim Horton's on campus is so long that I decide to walk the two blocks down to Roast. And why not? It's so pretty inside, and the atmosphere is nice - not too casual and not too upscale to the point of being stuffy. The coffee is good. My favorite drink so far is probably the pumpkin latte, but I also enjoyed the maple bacon latte. Yes bacon and coffee together is a good thing. The food is pretty good too. They have a Thai sandwich from MRKT which was good, although I found their chocolate pastry a little dry. Prices are your typical nice coffee shop price - equal to being at a chain like Starbuck's - except Roast is a better coffeeshop.  Wifi is free and works well, except in the outdoor seating where I had a hard time picking up a signal. The staff are friendly too, and happy to make recommendations. It's a wine bar as well which I would love to check out one day - although during my breaks on school days I'll probably stick to caffeine.\"]"
